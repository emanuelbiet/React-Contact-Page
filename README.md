## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Requirements <a name = "requirements"></a>

After cloning this repo, you may need [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install and start the local server. In the future, I intend to deploy this project at heroku or netlify to make it easier to test.

---

### Installing

In the project root folder, you may execute

```sh
yarn install
```

or

```sh
npm install
```

to install its dependencies.

---

To run the project locally, you only need to run

```sh
yarn start
```
after installing its dependencies and the local server will be provided in http://localhost:3000
